Tweet plays bird songs (or anything else) matching filenames on your
filesystem.

You can edit www/js/tweet.js to list the location or locations where
you keep these bird songs, for instance, /storage/extSdCard/Tweet/
Tweet does not need to write to this directory, so even on KitKat
and above you should be able to put them nearly anywhere.
