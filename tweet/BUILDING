Tweet is built on PhoneGap/Cordova.

For a description of how I set up my environment, see:
http://shallowsky.com/blog/programming/cross-platform-android-toolkits.html

It requires the file plug-in to play the birdsong MP3 files
on your SD card:
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file

To build it, add platforms (I've only tested this on Android):
cordova platforms add android

Then build:
cordova build

To build a signed release, create a file called
platforms/android/release-signing.properties, and put this in it:

storeFile=/path/to/your-keystore.keystore
storeType=jks
keyAlias=some-key
// if you don't want to enter the password at every build, use this:
keyPassword=your-key-password
storePassword=your-store-password

Then build:
cordova build android --release
