FeedViewer is an Android app to read feeds generated by FeedMe,
https://github.com/akkana/feedme

It has some problems -- for instance, it doesn't always remember its
scroll position on every page, on account of Android's WebView being
a buggy piece of crapware. Believe me, I've spent many hours trying.

# THIS CODE IS OBSOLETE.

It builds using ant, which no longer works on current Android SDKs,
and it doesn't import into Android Studio either.
Instead, see the newer version built with Android Studio and gradle:
