A few small Android projects I've built mostly for my own use.

FeedViewer: View RSS feeds created with Feedme.
  Java, Ant build.

WebClient: Run web applications from an Android launcher,
  so I can write simple Android apps in HTML without needing Java
  or a large complex build environment and SDK.
  Java, Ant build.

Tweet: Play bird songs from a directory.
  Built on PhoneGap/Cordova.
