A few small Android projects I've built mostly for my own use.

These projects are old (last maintained in 2017) and built with ant,
not gradle, so most of them probably won't work with Androids past
Marshmallow or thereabouts. There's a new version of FeedViewer at
https://github.com/akkana/FeedViewer

FeedViewer: View RSS feeds created with Feedme.
  Java, Ant build.

WebClient: Run web applications from an Android launcher,
  so I can write simple Android apps in HTML without needing Java
  or a large complex build environment and SDK.
  Java, Ant build.

Tweet: Play bird songs from a directory.
  Built on PhoneGap/Cordova.
